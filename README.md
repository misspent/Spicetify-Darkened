<h1 align="center">üì• Installation</h1>

You **WILL** need this to use this theme on spotify: https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli

Go into your `Themes` folder in `.spicetify` then do
```
git clone https://github.com/misspent/Darkened-spicetify
```
Open **Powershell** and run the following:
```
spicetify config current_theme Darkened-spicetify
spicetify apply
```


<h1 align="center">üìù Information</h1>

üìå Important |
 ------------ |
This is one of those **"Premium Only"** themes as I will not add support, fix or update the classes for ads because they'll try their hardest to make it a pain in the arse; it'd get tedious extremely quick.  |
Something I'll say that some people may dislike or want to punch me for saying; I do use a **"Spotify Premium Lifetime"** service as paying the total price per month for no ads + downloading your playlist(s) to listen offline is a rip-off. |
I have no intentions of using an extension with Spotify as I use it purely for music in the background. I don't use anything that shows lyrics, Reddit posts, makes it compact, or any other possible extension that sound/seem like a good idea but, in my opinion, is worthless; however, if you do use extension(s), please let me know, and If it's an extension worthwhile in my opinion (reddit one is a no), I'll add support for it. |

### ‚úÖ Features
* ‚úîÔ∏è Dark + Dark purple
* ‚úîÔ∏è I Use Spotify daily, so it *should* stay up-to-date
* ‚ùå Premium only (It may break/look odd with ads, I'm not sure)
* ‚≠ï Might start adding support to extension at some point regardless of whether or not people request

<h1 align="center">üìú Credits</h1>

As usual, I decided to take what Nyria made and make my "own" version of it. Moreover, I also took some of her installation section as I'm lazy, and she did it the way I would've done it. If you can't tell already, her themes are to die for, but I like them dark, not blue/bright. Thank you Nyria and keep up the great work!
* The original/base theme: [Nyria's Theme](https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-spicetify).

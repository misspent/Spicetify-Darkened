<h1 align="center">üì• Installation</h1>

You `WILL` need this to use this theme on spotify: https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli

Go into your `Themes` folder in `.spicetify` then do
```
git clone https://github.com/misspent/Darkened-spicetify
```
Open **Powershell** and run the following:
```
spicetify config current_theme Darkened-spicetify
spicetify apply
```


<h1 align="center">üìù Information</h1>
Most if not all colours are ‚Äúhard coded‚Äù so you won‚Äôt be able to change them through the config; If I make it so everything can be changed properly I‚Äôll update this readme + inform you.
This is my custom version of Nyrias Spotify theme. I will more than likely keep updating it as I use spotify frequently.
I have spotify premium and will never use spotify without it nor do I use any extensions.


<h1 align="center">üìú Credits</h1>

As usual, I decided to take what Nyria made and make my "own" version of it. Moreover, I also took some of her installation section from her readme as I'm lazy, and she did it the way I would've done it. If you can't tell already, her themes are to die for, but I like them dark, not blue/bright. Thank you, Nyria and keep up the great work!
* The original/base theme: https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-spicetify

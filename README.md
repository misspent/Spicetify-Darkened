### ✅ Features
* ✔️ Customizable

* ✔️ Marketplace extension support
* ✔️ Pop-up Lyrics extension support
* ✔️ Doesn't change artists banners
* ❌ Premium only (It may break/look odd without, I'm not sure)
* ❌ Friends sections may not be up-to-date(?) as I don't use it nor have anyone added on Spotify
* 📅 Might start adding support for extension at some point regardless of whether or not people request

📌 Important |
 ------------ |
This is one of those **"Premium Only"** themes as I will not add support, fix or update the classes for ads because they'll try their hardest to make it a pain in the arse; it'd get tedious extremely quick.  |
I have no intentions of using odd extensions with Spotify as I use it purely for music in the background. I don't use anything that shows lyrics, Reddit posts, makes it compact, or any other possible extension that sound/seem like a good idea but, in my opinion, are worthless; however, if you do use extension(s), please let me know, and If it's an extension worthwhile in my opinion, I'll add support for it. |

As usual, I decided to take what Nyria made and make my "own" version of it. Moreover, I also took some of his installation section as I'm lazy, and he did it the way I would've done it. If you can't tell already, his themes are to die for, but I like them dark, not blue/bright. Thank you Nyria and keep up the great work!
